- You need to be on a mac to follow these instructions.
- First get python 3.12for your local Mac system:
curl https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.6/python-3.12.6-macos11.pkg > ~/Desktop/python-3.12.6-macos11.pkg
- Note: it is not sufficient to have a conda env with python 3.12, you have to
  install 3.12 as the system python.
- Then, tag your release and push it upstream as in a normal release. That will
  build the linux versions and deploy to pypi.
- Get cibuildwheel:
pip install cibuildwheel
- Also install twine:
pip install twine
- Then build the wheels:
python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse .
# - Optionally deploy to testpypi:
# python -m twine upload --skip-existing --verbose -r testpypi wheelhouse/*
- Deploy to pypi:
python -m twine upload --skip-existing --verbose -r pypi -u __token__ -p
<pypi_access_token> wheelhouse/*
